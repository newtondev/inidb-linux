## How to Install on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

How to use:
To use "iniDB" in your mission, install the extension in your ARMA2 or ARMA3 directory by making an @inidb folder in the root of your ArmA3 installation and copying over the files required.
Don't forget to create a /db/ folder where your db files will be stored per player.
It should look like: /Arma 3/@inidbi/iniDB.so
It should look like: /Arma 3/@inidbi/db/
It should look like: /Arma 3/@inidbi/Addons/inidbi.pbo
